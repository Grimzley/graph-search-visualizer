# Graph Search Visualizer

Developed an interactive web-based pathfinding visualizer using PyScript, enabling real-time exploration of graph traversal algorithms\
Enhanced usability with a responsive Bootstrap interface, including dropdowns, controls, and visual indicators to improve clarity\
Implemented dynamic user interaction features including click-and-drag wall placement, movable start/end points, and keyboard shortcuts

###### Keyboard Shortcuts and Controls

Left Clicking converts the hovered cell into a wall\
Right Clicking converts the hovered cell into a path\
Clicking and dragging also converts cells accordingly

S = Move the Start Node to the hovered cell\
E = Move the End Node to the hovered cell\
SPACE = begin searching for a path from the Start Node to the End Node\
D = Switch between allowing adjacent movement and orthogonal movement\
R = Clear search results\
C = Clear the walls and search results
